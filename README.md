Overview
Vulnerability Scanner is a Python tool designed to detect and mitigate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in web applications. This tool utilizes various techniques to scan web pages for potential XSS vulnerabilities, including crawling the target website, analyzing HTML forms, and testing different XSS payloads.

Features
Automated Crawling: The tool automatically crawls through the target website to discover links and forms that may be vulnerable to XSS attacks.
Form Analysis: It analyzes HTML forms to identify potential XSS vulnerabilities, including form submission testing with customizable XSS payloads.
Link Testing: It tests URL parameters for XSS vulnerabilities by injecting payloads and analyzing the server's response.
Customizable Payloads: Users can provide custom XSS payloads to test for specific vulnerabilities.
Output to File: Results can be saved to a specified output file for further analysis and logging.
Usage
Specify the target URL and links to ignore (e.g., logout URLs) in the Scanner class instantiation.
Customize XSS payloads in the run_scanner method.
Run the tool to scan the target website for XSS vulnerabilities.
View the results either in the console or in the specified output file.
